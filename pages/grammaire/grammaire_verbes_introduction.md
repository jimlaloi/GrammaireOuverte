tense 
Tense is the grammatical term that refers to the time when the action of the verb occurs: past, present, future. The time frame of an action is usually established by referring to the present moment; for example, the passé composé and the future are respectively past and future in relation to the present. 
However, some tenses establish their time frame by referring to other actions in the past or in the future. For example, the plus-que-parfait tense indicates a past action that occurred prior to the the completion of another past action. The futur antérieur tense indicates a future action that will have occured before another future action. Actions that occur before another action are described as being anterior. 
Tenses are also described by their number of parts. For example, a tense with only one verb form is called a simple tense (ie, le passé simple). In contrast, a tense comprising two forms, the auxiliary verb and the participle, is referred to as a compound tense (ie, le passé composé). 





aspect 
Aspect, unlike tense, is not concerned with placing events on a time line. Rather, aspect is concerned with making distinctions about the kinds of actions that are described by verbs: progressive actions, punctual actions, habitual actions, etc. 

The most important aspectual distinction in French concerns the difference between the two most common past tenses: the imparfait and the passé composé. While both tenses refer to actions in the past, they are used for very different types of actions. The imparfait indicates an action that is ongoing or habitual. Actions in the imparfait may be simultaneous or overlapping. The passé composé on the other hand, indicates an action that is in a strict sequence in relation to another action. In other words, an event in the passé composé must be completed before another may be used in narration. 
These aspectual differences are best understood in a narrative context where the imparfait is typically used to set the scene of a story by giving background information. 
Installé à la terrasse du Cactus Cafe, Tex Seated on the terrace of the Cactus Cafe, regardait les filles qui passaient. Il Tex was watching the girls who walked savourait une tasse de café, mais quelque by. He was enjoying a cup of coffee, but chose manquait . . . une cigarette! something was missing . . . a cigarette! 
The passé composé is used for the foreground, that is, the plot line events. Note that plot line events are sequential, that is, an event must be completed before another event begins. 
Tex a sorti une cigarette de son paquet. Il Tex took out a cigarette from his pack. l'a allumée et il a tiré une grande bouffée. He lit it and took a long drag. Mmm ... Mmm ... extase! ecstasy! 






mood 
Mood is a grammatical category distinguishing verb tenses. There are four moods in French: indicative, subjunctive, conditional, and imperative. All of these moods, except the imperative, may be conjugated in different tenses. Each of these moods has a different function. 



The indicative mood is the most common and is used to relate facts and objective statements. 
Tammy se réveille tôt le matin. Tammy gets up (present tense of the indicative early in the mood) morning. 


The subjunctive mood is used more commonly in French than in English. It is used to express opinions and feelings (subjective thoughts). 
Il est dommage que les parents de Tex It is too bad that Tex's parents are dead. soient morts. (present tense of the subjunctive mood) 


The conditional mood is used to express hypothetical or contrary-to-fact statements. 
Si Corey était beau, il aurait une copine. If Corey were handsome, he would have (present tense of the conditional a girlfriend. mood) 



The imperative mood is used to give direct orders or commands. Tex, réveille-toi ! Tex, get up! 


voice 
Voice is a grammatical category describing the relationship between a verb and its subject. Voice is either active or passive. Active voice refers to the situation where the subject of the sentence performs the action of the verb. 
Les autorités ont expulsé Tex de France. The authorities expelled Tex from France. 


On the other hand, passive voice refers to the situation where the subject receives the action of the verb. 
Tex a été expulsé de France (par les Tex was expelled from France (by the autorités). authorities).

ways to avoid the passive 


'Voice' refers to the relationship between the subject and the verb in a sentence. A sentence is said to be in the active voice if the subject is performing the action of the verb. For example, 'Tex is calling Tammy.' In this sentence, the subject (Tex) performs the action of calling Tammy. Active subjects are called 'agents'. 
The passive voice, on the other hand, refers to a sentence in which the subject receives the action. In other words, the subject is passive, or acted upon by the agent. For example: 'Tammy is being called by Tex.' In this sentence, Tammy receives the action performed by Tex, the agent. 

formation 
= conjugated form of être + past participle of main verb (+ par + agent) Note that the past participle always agrees in number and gender with the 
subject.  
Les Aggies sont battus (par les Longhorns).  The Aggies are beaten (by the Longhorns).  
Les Aggies ont été battus (par les Longhorns).  The Aggies were beaten (by the Longhorns).  
Les Aggies seront battus (par les Longhorns).  The Aggies will be beaten (by the Longhorns).  




The agent, when mentioned, is usually preceded by par. However, with the verbs aimer, connaître, and respecter, the agent is introduced by de instead. 
Tammy est aimée de Tex.  Tammy is loved by Tex.  
Tex est bien connu de toutes les étudiantes  Tex is well-known to all the female students  
et respecté de tous les professeurs.  and respected by all the professors.  




uses 
The passive voice places the focus on the object of the verb rather than the subject: 

Tex a écrit le livre Guerre Tex wrote the book War 
et Amour. and Love. Le livre Guerre et The book War and Love Amour a été écrit par Tex. was written by Tex. 
The passive voice draws attention to an event without necessarily mentioning who is responsible for it: 

Oh, Corey et Fiona ont été Oh, Corey and Fiona were enlevés! abducted! 



The passive voice is often used for inventions, laws, and, logically enough, for events that one falls victim to: Les parents de Tex ont été écrasés. Tex' parents were run over. La loi SOS-tatou a été votée. The SOS-armadillo law has been passed. 


Un nouveau genre de grammaire a été créé. A new kind of grammar was created. 
ways to avoid the passive 
The passive voice is used more frequently in English than in French. Thus, in French, when the agent of the verb can be 
identified, it is better to use the active voice and make the agent the subject of the verb. A common way to avoid the passive in French is to use the active voice with on as the subject. For example, 'I was told that Tex loves Tammy' would be translated as 'Onm'a dit que Tex aimait Tammy'. 
When making general statements about known facts, pronominal verbs are often used: 





Le football américain se joue à onze. 
Le vin rouge se boit à température ambiante. Les frites se mangent avec du ketchup. Le français se parle en Louisiane. 
Listen to the dialogue: 

Tammy et Tex regardent les informations à la télé. Le journaliste déclare: 
Aujourd'hui, l'équipe des Aggies a été battue et le moral des joueurs est profondément affecté par cette défaite, la dixième fois de suite cette saison. Par contre, les Longhorns ont beaucoup de succès. Depuis que le trophée Heisman a été remporté par le légendaire Ricky Williams, rien ne les arrête. 


Football is played with 11 players. Red wine is drunk at room temperature. 
Fries are eaten with ketchup. French is spoken in Louisiana. 
Tammy and Tex are watching the news on TV. The journalist states: 
Today, the team of the Aggies was defeated and the morale of the players is deeply affected by this defeat, the tenth time in a row this season. In contrast, the Longhorns are having a lot of success. Since the Heisman trophy was won by the lengendary Ricky Williams, nothing can stop them.

A verb may be defined as the 'action word of the sentence'. To determine whether a word is a verb or not, consider its role in the sentence. How is the word 'access' used in the following sentences? 
Never give strangers access to your bank account. If you can't access the web pages during peak hours, try again. 
In the first sentence, 'access' is a thing (a noun) that you can give to somebody. In the second sentence, 'access' is something you do (a verb) with your computer. The point is that whether a word is considered a noun or a verb depends on how it is used in the sentence. 


infinitives and conjugations 
When you study verbs, you will need to know the difference between the infinitive form of the verb and the finite forms, or conjugated forms. English infinitives are preceded by the word 'to'. 

to eat, to drink, to sleep 
These verbs are called infinitives because, like the concept of infinity, they are not bound by time. From the infinitive, we derive the conjugated forms of the verb, also known as the finite forms of the verb. They are called finite because they refer to events anchored in time, that is, to events that have a particular tense: past, present, future. Note the conjugated forms of the infinitive 'to study'. 
I studied French  past tense conjugation  
in high school.  
I am studying French  present tense conjugation  
in college this semester.  
I will study French  future tense conjugation  
next year overseas.  



Verb conjugations are traditionally presented in textbooks according to paradigms, a grammatical term for pattern. A paradigm always includes the infinitive followed by the conjugations according to person which is divided into first, second and third, as well as number, which is the distinction between singular and plural. 

Regular French verbs fall into three classes based on the last two letters of the verb. Each class has a particular pattern of conjugation. These classes of verbs are generally referred to as first conjugation, second conjugation and third conjugation. 


participles 
A participle is a special verb form that is derived from the infinitive but is not conjugated. In other words, while conjugations come in paradigms of six forms according to six different persons, participles have only two forms, named according to their uses: the present participle and the past participle. 
A present participle in French ends in -ant and is frequently used as an adjective. French present participles are usually translated by the -ing form of the English verb. Note that the adjectival form of the present participle must agree in number and gender with the noun it modifies. In the example, the participle is made to agree with the plural noun (les animaux) by adding -s. 
Les tatous sont des animaux fascinants. Armadillos are fascinating animals. 



A past participle in French is used to form compound tenses, such as the 'passé composé'. A past participle can also be used as an adjective in certain contexts. When used as an adjective, the participle agrees in number and gender 
with the noun it qualifies.  
Tex a perdu une lettre d'amour de  Tex lost a love letter from Bette.  
Bette.  
Et Tammy a trouvé la lettre perdue!  And Tammy found the lost letter!  


In the first example, the participle 'perdu' combines with the auxiliary verb to form the past tense of perdre (to lose). In the second example, the participle is used as an adjective to modify the noun 'la lettre'. Note how the final -e on the participle indicates agreement with the feminine noun. 


common auxiliaries and modals 
Auxiliaries, often called 'helping verbs', are verbs that combine with the main verb to form a verb phrase. There are two groups of auxiliary verbs: common auxiliaries and modals. The two common auxiliary verbs in French, avoir (to have) and être (to be) are used to form many tenses. A tense that has only a main verb and no auxiliary is called a simple tense. A verb tense that is composed of a main verb and its auxiliary is called a compound tense. 
Joe-Bob écoute de la musique country. Joe-Bob listens to country music. 
Joe-Bob a écouté de la musique Joe-Bob has listened to country music. 

country. 

In the first example, the main verb 'écouter' is in the simple present tense. In the second example, the verb is in the compound past tense, a tense which combines the auxiliary verb 'avoir' with the past participle of 'écouter'. 
Modals are special auxiliary verbs that express the attitude of the speaker. In short, modal verbs are 'moody verbs'. For example, modal verbs indicate subtle shades of meaning concerning such things as the likelihood of an event or the moral obligation of an event. The most frequent modal verbs in English are the following: should, could, may, might, ought to, must. 
Note how the following modal verbs in French and English convey an attitude of increased urgency. 






Tex peut quitter la France. Tex can leave France. Tex devrait quitter la France! Tex should leave France! Tex doit quitter la France!! Tex must leave France!! 

transitive vs. intransitive verbs 
Transitive verbs require a direct object while intransitive verbs do not permit an object. A direct object is usually defined as the party which directly receives the action designated by the verb. The terms 'transitive' and 'intransitive' are derived from the grammatical term transitivity which refers to the transfer of an action from the subject (S) to the direct object (DO). 
Transitive Tex (S) écrit un poème (DO). Tex writes a poem. 
Intransitive Tex (S) sort. Tex goes out. 



French vs. English verbs 
There is one important difference between French and English verbs that often causes trouble for beginning language learners. There is a high frequency of English verbs which combine with a particle (typically a preposition) to express idiomatic meanings. English speakers can completely change the meaning of the verb by changing the 

In order to convey the differences in meaning of the 'get + particle' constructions, note how French makes use of completely different verbs. As a consequence, when you translate such verbs from English into French, you must never translate word-for-word (i.e. translating the verb and particle separately). Since the verb and particle 'go together' in English, they must be translated as a unit in French.

definitions: transitive direct, transitive indirect, intransitive 
Transitive verbs by definition have an object, either a direct object or an indirect object. Intransitive verbs never have objects. 
A transitive-direct verb acts directly on its object. In the first sentence below, the telephone is the direct object. The verb 'entendre' (to hear) always takes an object; one hears someone or something. 



A transitive-indirect verb acts to or for its object. Tex is the object of the preposition à in the second sentence since Joe-Bob is talking to him. 
Intransitive verbs, on the other hand, have no object at all. The verb dormir (to sleep) in the last example, does not need any object to complete it. In fact, because the verb is intransitive, it cannot take an object. Intransitive verbs (as well as transitive ones) may be modified by adverbs or prepositional phrases: 'Joe-Bob sleeps in the car; he sleeps all the time.' 
Tex entend le téléphone.  transitive-direct  Tex hears the telephone.  
Joe-Bob parle à Tex.  transitive-indirect  Job-Bob is talking to Tex.  
Joe-Bob dort souvent au volant.  intransitive  Joe-Bob often sleeps at the wheel.  

For more examples and discussion, review the remarks on transitive vs intransitive verbs in the introduction. 




transitive verbs 
Because transitivity has to do with meaning, most English and French verbs usually maintain the same distinction. Thus, verbs that are transitive in English are also transitive in French, and verbs that are intransitive in French are also intransitive in English. The following examples are transitive in both French and English. 

Tex mange un croissant et il boit du café. Tex is eating a croissant and drinking some coffee. 
Il finit son petit déjeuner He is finishing his breakfast 
et il lit le journal. Dring, dring. C'est Joe-and reading the newspaper. Ring, ring. It's Bob au téléphone. Joe-Bob on the telephone. 



special cases 
direct object in French / preposition + object in English 
There are, however, special cases where the transitivity of French and English verbs contrast. There are several very common verbs which take a direct object in French, while the English equivalent is followed by a preposition (at, to, for) and object. REDCAP is an acronym for the most frequent verbs in this category: Regarder, Ecouter, Demander, Chercher, Attendre, Payer. 


Joe-Bob explains what happened: 


Joe-Bob: Je roulais en voiture. Je regardais Joe-Bob: I was driving along. I was looking les filles. at girls. 
J'écoutais de la musique country à la radio. I was listening to country music on the radio. 
Et puis, oh, là là. J'ai eu un accident de voiture. La police est arrivée et le flic m'a demandé mes papiers. 
J'ai cherché ma carte d'identité, mais je ne l'ai pas trouvée. 
Pas de chance! Je suis au commissariat et j'attends mon avocat. 
Tex, j'espère que tu vas payer la contravention! 
And then, oh, la, la. I had an accident. The police came and the cop asked for my papers. 
I looked for my ID, but I didn't find it. 
No luck! I'm at the police station and I'm waiting for my lawyer. 
Tex, I hope that you will pay for the ticket. 


preposition + object in French / direct object in English 
There are also several verbs which have a preposition and object in French, whereas the English equivalent takes a direct object. 
Joe-Bob téléphone à Tex. Joe-Bob telephones à Tex. 
Here are examples of such verbs. These are discussed more fully with indirect objects and indirect object pronouns. 
obéir à, to obey  répondre à, to answer  
pardonner à, to pardon, to forgive  résister à, to resist  
rendre visite à, to visit (someone)  ressembler à, to resemble  
renoncer à, to give up, renounce  téléphoner à, to telephone  


stated and implied objects 
For many transitive verbs, in both French and English, the object is sometimes implied or understood. Do not be concerned about labelling these verbs, since the meaning will be clear from the context; and, like most verbs, they will form their passé composé with avoir. 
transitive verb / implied object transitive verb / stated object 
En voiture, Joe-Bob chante toujours. (Joe-En voiture, Joe-Bob chante toujours Bob always sings in the car.) Freebird. (Joe-Bob always sings Freebird in the car.) 
Il parle fort. (He talks loudly.) Il parle anglais. (He speaks English.) 
Il rêve. (He dreams.) Il rêve de hamburgers et de filles. (He dreams of hamburgers and girls.) 





Il grignotte tout le temps. (He snacks all the Il grignotte des cacahouettes. (He snacks on time.) peanuts.) 



intransitive verbs 
Perhaps you have already seen verbs which use être to form the passé composé. These être verbs (aller, arriver, partir, sortir, etc.) are the most frequent intransitive verbs and they are summarized in the Alamo d'être. Etre verbs are often described as verbs of motion, but it's important to note that there are many other intransitive verbs of motion which use the auxiliary avoir, for example, 'marcher' (to walk) and 'courir' (to run): 'Tex a marché vite. Les enfants de Rita ont couru.' 

transitive or intransitive 
Some verbs may be either transitive or intransitive. Contrast the following verbs. Note that the verb sortir uses the auxiliary verb être in the passé composé as an intransitive verb, but avoir in the passé composé when it is used 
transitively.  

 intransitive / no object  transitive / used with an object  
Le week-end passé, Joe-Bob est sorti. (Last weekend Joe-Bob went out.)  Le week-end passé, Joe-Bob a sorti son beau camion. (Last weekend Joe-Bob took out his fine truck.)  
Au commissariat, la tension de Joe-Bob monte. (At the police station Joe-Bob's blood pressure goes up.)  Joe-Bob monte l'escalier. (Joe-Bob goes up the stairs.)  


There are several cases where a verb which may be transitive or intransitive in English must be translated by two different verbs in French: 'to return' (retourner, rendre), 'to leave' (partir, laisser, quitter). 


verbs with direct and indirect objects 
Many transitive verbs may have both a direct and an indirect object, for example: Tex donne des conseils à Joe-Bob. Tex gives advice to Joe-Bob. 



Here is a list of some common bivalent verbs: 

acheter, to buy expliquer, to explain apporter, to bring montrer, to show apprendre, to learn offrir, to offer (give) demander, to ask prêter, to lend donner, to give promettre, to promise écrire, to write rendre, to give back emprunter, to borrow servir, to serve envoyer, to send vendre, to sell 
Indicate whether the verb in the sentence is transitive, 't' or intransitive, 'i'. 

6.
